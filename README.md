# Project JalDrishti (Himachal AI Flood Alert)

A real-time, AI-powered flood detection system using a hybrid model (**YOLOv8 + Color/Turbidity Analysis**) to monitor rivers in Himachal Pradesh. It sends urgent, bilingual alerts to district-specific Telegram channels.

## Project Overview

Flash floods are a major threat in Himachal Pradesh. **JalDrishti** provides a scalable and automated solution to monitor high-risk river locations 24/7.

It uses a lightweight but effective AI model to detect floods with high accuracy, minimizing false positives and allowing it to run even on free CPU hardware (like **Streamlit Cloud**).

When a threat is confirmed, the system automatically sends a **critical bilingual alert** (English & Hindi) to private Telegram channels for each district ‚Äî ensuring that residents and travelers get real-time warnings.

---

## Key Features

* **Real-Time Monitoring**
  Analyze live webcam feeds (via `streamlit-webrtc`) or pre-recorded videos.

* **Lightweight AI Detection (CPU-Friendly)**

  * **YOLOv8 Segmentation** ‚Äì Detects river boundaries.
  * **Color Analysis (Turbidity)** ‚Äì Measures the percentage of brown/muddy water (a flood indicator).

* **Robust Alerting System**
  Uses a moving average (`deque`) to send alerts only if a flood condition persists (e.g., 75% of frames in the last minute).

* **District-Based Subscriptions**
  Users subscribe only to districts they care about via a Telegram bot.

* **Urgent Bilingual Alerts**
  Alerts are automatically sent in both **English and Hindi**.

* **Secure Configuration**
  All tokens and channel IDs are safely managed with **Streamlit Secrets Management (`secrets.toml`)**.

---

## System Architecture

This project has **two main components:**

### 1. `app.py` (The Monitor / Detection Script)

* Built with **Streamlit**
* Reads frames from webcam or video input
* Runs YOLOv8 for river segmentation
* Performs **turbidity analysis** on river region
* Uses a **moving average** to track persistent flood frames
* Triggers alerts when flood threshold (e.g., 75%) is met
* Sends alerts via Telegram using channel IDs stored in `st.secrets`

### 2. `bot.py` (The Subscription Manager)

* Built using **python-telegram-bot**
* Manages user subscriptions
* Provides district selection buttons
* Sends private invite links for each district‚Äôs alert channel

## üöÄ Setup & Deployment

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python **3.11+**
* Telegram account
* GitHub repository
* Streamlit Cloud account (for `app.py`)
* A 24/7 hosting service for `bot.py` (PythonAnywhere, Render, or VPS)

---

### 2. Create Telegram Bot & Channels

1. **Create a Bot**
   Use [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create your bot and save the bot token.

2. **Create Private Channels**
   For each district (e.g., `Mandi District Flood Alerts`).

3. **Add Bot as Admin**
   Give it ‚ÄúPost messages‚Äù permission.

4. **Get Invite Links & Channel IDs**

   * Use `@RawDataBot` to find channel IDs (e.g., `-1003213730436`).
   * Create private invite links (e.g., `t.me/+...`).

---

### 3. Local Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jaldrishti.git
cd jaldrishti

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Configuration

#### **Configure `bot.py`**

```python
BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"

DISTRICT_INVITE_LINKS = {
    "mandi": "t.me/+abcd1234",
    "shimla": "t.me/+xyz7890",
    ...
}
```

#### **Configure `app.py`**

* Set the `LOCATION_ID` for the monitoring site.
* Ensure `LOCATION_TO_DISTRICT_MAP` matches district names.
* Load your YOLOv8 model (`best.pt`) in the `load_models()` function.

#### **Create Secrets File**

`/.streamlit/secrets.toml`

```toml
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"

[district_channel_map]
mandi_district = "-100......."
kullu_district = "-100......."
shimla_district = "-100......."
bilaspur_district = "-100......."
chamba_district = "-100......."
hamirpur_district = "-100......."
kangra_district = "-100......."
lahaul_and_spiti_district = "-100......."
sirmaur_district = "-100......."
solan_district = "-100......."
una_district = "-100......."
kinnaur_district = "-100......."
```

---

### 5. Running the System

#### **A. Run the Telegram Subscription Bot**

Keep this running 24/7 on your VPS or PythonAnywhere:

```bash
python bot.py
```

*(Tip: Use `nohup python bot.py &` or a systemd service for background execution.)*

#### **B. Run the Flood Monitoring App**

Run one instance of this app for each location:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with Google Maps to visualize live flood locations
* Support for rainfall & temperature sensor data
